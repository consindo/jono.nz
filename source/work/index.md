# Portfolio

## Sandfield
While studying at the [University of Auckland](https://www.auckland.ac.nz), I'm also employed as an Intern at [Sandfield](https://www.sandfield.co.nz). I'm working with the [Crossfire EDI](http://crossfireedi.com/) team where we have built a web app for customers to manage their orders, products, and EDI implementations. I work with the full stack, developing with ES6, React, ASP.NET, and Microsoft SQL Server. 

Through the creation of this app, we have seen a significant reduction in support time and costs for the Crossfire EDI product.

## Side Projects
For many years I have loved building open-source apps as an opportunity to learn new technologies and skills outside of work and school.

### Transit
[Transit](https://transit.dymajo.com) is a progressive web app for getting around Auckland. It uses Auckland Transport's GTFS and real-time data to provide an easy way to check lines and schedules on the go.

### Nitro
[Nitro](http://nitrotasks.com) is a cross platform task management app built with web technologies. I'm working on a new version and you can [sign up for early access](http://nitrotasks.com).

### Transfer
[Transfer](https://dymajo.com) was supposed to be the best FTP + SFTP app for Windows. However, a public release is not currently possible due to issues with the Windows Store and our application architecture. If we can't distribute the app in the store, we will open-source the code in the future.

### Other Projects
I helped build [Gradiator](https://launchpad.net/gradiator) (a CSS gradients app), [Lightread](https://github.com/stayradiated/LightRead) - which [won the first Ubuntu App Showdown](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/08/ubuntu-app-showdown-winners-announced), and [Stormcloud](https://github.com/consindo/stormcloud) - a weather app that was [the best selling app in the Ubuntu Store ever](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/tag/stormcloud). These projects have not been maintained, but the source code is available to download and modify.

## Micro Projects
My micro projects are similar to my side projects, but they only do one thing and do it well.

### GPA Calculator
[GPA Calculator](/projects/gpa/) is a basic web app to calculate what grade you need so you don't fail.

### swipeviewjs
[swipeviewjs](https://github.com/consindo/swipeviewjs) is a minimal Android style swipeview for the web, primarily used in [Transit](https://transit.dymajo.com).
