I have quite a few subscriptions, both online and offline. I quite like a lot of these things, so I thought I would share.

## Online

### Spotify

I've had a [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/nz/) subscription ever since it came to NZ in 2012. I still think it's the best all around music streaming service. I'm currently using a family plan, with five friends. Apparently we're all live together in a one bedroom apartment. **$3.75/month.**

### 1Password

I've also been using [1Password](1password.com) ever since the subscription service started, and I'm still really happy with it. I love they have fantastic apps on every platform—I use the Windows, Mac, Android, and Web apps on a daily basis. Like Spotify, I share it with a large group of friends. **$1 USD/month.**

### Day One

Unlike 1Password, the [Day One](https://dayoneapp.com/) apps outside of the Apple ecosystem aren't very good. Despite this, I still find it to be a fantastic app for keeping a journal because it's so specialized to the task. I use it every day, and it sets me back **$2.92/month.**

### DigitalOcean

I run a [DigitalOcean Kubernetes cluster](https://m.do.co/c/359af8087554) that runs Waka and the everylotbots. I don't run everything on it though. I still have a home server cluster running [microk8s](https://microk8s.io/), that runs a [UniFi controller](https://unifi-network.ui.com/), [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), and a few other things. I manage to only use a single Digital Ocean instance, which ends up costing **$38/month.**

### AWS Lightsail

These days, I only spend a couple of dollars with AWS a month. I run a tiny [Lightsail](https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/) instance, for my Mum's Wordpress site. **$3.50 USD/month.**

### Xbox Game Pass

The [Xbox Game Pass](https://www.xbox.com/en-NZ/xbox-game-pass) library is getting pretty large for PC these days (~100 games). Microsoft often advertise offers where they'll give you **3 months for $1**. Afterwards, I cancel and go back to my purchased games until another offer comes up.

### Photoshop & Lightroom

There's now a [free version of Lightroom](https://www.adobe.com/nz/products/photoshop-lightroom.html) in AU/NZ, but I do enough photo editing to justify paying for it. Photoshop also comes in handy sometimes. I share this with a friend, so if I'm away from my desktop PC, I have to do my editing over remote desktop. **$7.50 AUD/month.**

### Sharesies

I do most of my investing through [Sharesies](https://sharesies.nz/r/CRDHC6), which I find pretty good. It doesn't charge transaction fees, but there is a small monthly charge based on the amount you have invested. I've also tried a few other platforms—Hatch, which lets you buy US shares, and Link Market Services. The fees tend to be higher, and the user experience isn't nearly as good. I end up spending **$3/month on Sharesies fees**, but try to invest a few hundred every month.

### YNAB

I use [YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/) to keep my budget under control, and I find it saves me hundreds of dollars every month. I wish it had bank feeds in NZ, but bank feeds are difficult, even in the UK & EU with open Banking. YNAB costs **$7 USD/month**, but it's worth every cent.

## Offline

### 2degrees Phone + Internet

I get both through [2degrees](https://www.2degrees.nz/), which tends to have the best international peering. At home, I get 1Gbps and a static IP for **$110/month**. I also have their **$27/month mobile plan** which gives a measly 2.5GB of data. 

### Auckland Transport

I'm trying to cycle to work more this year, and work from home when the weather isn't good. As a result, I'm not spending a lot on the [relatively expensive train/bus fares](https://at.govt.nz/bus-train-ferry/fares-discounts/bus-train-fares/) anymore ($7.80 for a return trip to the city). Last year, I was spending around $150 a month, but often spend **under $50/month** these days.

### News

I currently subscribe to [the Spinoff Members](https://members.thespinoff.co.nz/), and a print subscription to [Metro](https://www.metromag.co.nz/). I just cancelled my print subscription to [The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/), because I wasn't really reading it.

### Kōkako Coffee

Kōkako have a [coffee subscription](https://www.kokako.co.nz/collections/coffee-subscriptions) where they send you a different bag of their coffee every month. I originally received as a gift, but it's fabulous and I have every intention to continue it. A subscription will set you back **$15.50/month.**

### Cityhop Car Sharing

I don't own a car, but I've been using [Cityhop](https://www.cityhop.co.nz/) when I need one. It costs ~$10/hour or ~$60/day, depending on the vehicle. There's plenty of cars in the city centre, but I wish there was one walking distance from my house. I don't need it particularly often, so I spend **under $100/month**. It's still way cheaper than owning a car.

### Genesis **Electricity**

I currently have this through [Genesis](https://www.genesisenergy.co.nz/), because they offered a great sign up deal. It changes every month, but it usually ends up to be **less than $80/month**.

### Water

In Auckland, [water & wastewater](https://www.watercare.co.nz/) transmission is not included in your rates (technically, the water is free). **This is a good thing.** It's usually less than $20/month, but the [pipes don't explode in the street](https://twitter.com/Beywake/status/1367661874926415878).

### Auckland **Rates**

This is a bit of a deal. [Auckland](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/) has the cheapest rates in the country and the best amenities—there's fantastic parks, libraries, community centres, roads, rubbish collection, events, and more. It's **$100/month.** It should be more.

### Mortgage + Body Corporate + Insurance

It's by far my largest expense each month **(~$2000)**, but it's better than renting, and *way better* than flatting.

There's definitely things I've forgotten in the list (e.g domain names, credit card fees), but I think these are all the interesting items I pay for. Next time, I'll go through all the things I don't pay for.
