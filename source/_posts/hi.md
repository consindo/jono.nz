Hi, I'm Jono. I've had a couple of blogs over the years, but they tend to disappear as I abandon side projects and domain names. I finally have a domain name that I like, so I've decided to build a proper website. I haven't completely finished yet, but the aim is to have all my work, projects, and writing in one place.

Who am I? Well, that page isn't done yet, but I'm a student currently living in Auckland, New Zealand. At the moment, I study Computer Science & Applied Mathematics at the University of Auckland. On the side, I build websites for other people, make apps and travel the world.

I'm currently building a beautiful FTP + SFTP app for Windows 10. It's not released yet, but you can check it out and sign up to the beta at [dymajo.com](https://dymajo.com).

That's really it for now. Feel free to copy and share anything written on the blog, with attribution. The website design and source code is also freely available on [GitHub](https://github.com). Do whatever you like with it, but linking back is highly appreciated.
