I spent 30 minutes making a dumb map the other day, but figured it's worth a post here as it went [somewhat viral](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/hop-on-hop-off-tuck-in-aucklands-rapid-transit-kfc-map/YRDOFXP2V3DSJWJR2BR756SG54/).

I was mostly just messing around with Photoshop on the iPad editing Auckland Transport's excellent [rapid transit map](https://at.govt.nz/media/1986444/aucklands-rapid-transit-schematic-v3-1.pdf). Photoshop on iPad on the other hand, is not so excellent. Hopefully it continues to improve.

There's a couple of spots that were on the cusp of making the cut - Manukau & Akoranga. It's really not the distance that's the issue for these ones, but the oversized roads that you need to cross. Otahuhu almost made it, but the station is just a bit too far from the town centre. Hopefully one day, the town centre will sprawl all the way to the station.

There is a general lack of shops integrated into stations in Auckland. With the exception of Britomart, the most you'll get is a coffee stand in the concourse. It's not for a lack of space either, just ambition. Would love to see our stations become more like Hong Kong, or even Sydney.

How many of the KFCs have I actually visited on this map? Only Britomart, Newmarket, Panmure, Sylvia Park, and Auckland Airport. As much as I love KFC, I won't be taking up the challenge to hit all of these in a single day.
