This is the second installment of the dev log. Let's see if we can keep this streak going!

## Waka
I've made some improvements to health checks - they now check if the realtime data is working in Auckland. It's still at <https://assets-us-west-2.waka.app/status/index.html>, but will eventually be rolled into the app.

SMS notifications now trigger when the health checks fail (super simple with Amazon SNS), so I'll know a lot sooner if Waka is down.

I'm also trying to answer the question "What routes in Auckland travel the most km per week?". I should have the answer to that tomorrow, and I'll do a little bit of a writeup.

Other than that, there's been nothing done in actual Waka. Matt hasn't done anything on `waka-importer` either.

## Nitro 3
I've spent most of my time coding Nitro this month.

The overlay position is now fixed - no matter where it's opened from. However, it's a bit laggy in some browsers (Edge), and can be laggy on Retina screens. I'll fix it eventually, but not for the initial release. There's also a new sync indicator - when a task is syncing, an icon shows up.

The biggest change is from my own custom username/password auth to [Auth0](https://auth0.com). It provides a decent user experience, and I don't have to worry about other things such as sign up, 2FA, and OAuth. Unfortunately it seems to log you out a lot, but it's not a huge deal as it's only a single click to log back in.

I also fixed a couple of other bugs and papercuts:

- Added the sign out button back
- Added proper error messages on the login page
- Upgraded all dependencies
- Fixed the list ordering without all list
- Fixed a race condition when notes were being saved

Next month, I want to continue to focus on fixing bugs and improve the performance on slower machines and phones. I also want the sync to be a bit better - stopping your browser from closing if sync is in progress, and triggering a sync if you haven't been using Nitro for some time. Oh, and I still need to add the settings menu.

That's it for November! If you have any questions, flick them through to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/consindo), and I'll try answer them in the next post.
