I recently bought a Dell XPS 13, to replace my Surface Pro 3. These devices roughly cost the same, but I managed to snag a last generation XPS with the improved screen for the same price as a current generation with the regular HD display. I miss out on USB-C and improved graphics, but that's not a huge deal.

While both of these devices are a generation behind, they're very similar to the current model, so this comparison is still valid.

## What the XPS does better
- **Screen** This is the best part of the XPS 13. The 3200x1800 resolution is great, and apps like Photoshop look great at 200% scaling. There's more pixels on this thing than the 15" MacBook Pro! Oh, and the tiny bezels are beautiful.

- **Battery** Even with the crazy screen, the XPS lasts 9 hours. The Surface with a fresh battery only lasts 5 hours. The power management also seems a lot better - the Surface always used to randomly turn on in my bag.

- **Connectivity** The XPS has an extra USB port, lock slot and a full sized SD card reader. The newer model even has Thunderbolt over USB-C! Oh, and if you thought Broadcom Wi-Fi was bad, the Atheros chip in the Surface will drive your head through a wall.

## What the Surface does better
- **Stylus** The Surface has pen support, which works really well. It's great if you want to annotate things, or draw. However, I find paper better because you can spread it around on a table and refer back a bit easier. Oh, and since printing is an enormous hassle, I just handwrite my assignments anyway. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

- **Keyboard** The Type Cover 4 is less mushy, even though it has less travel.

- **Audio** The Surface has front facing speakers and never any software issues. On the XPS, very occasionally headphones aren't detected or the sound quality deteriorates (a reboot fixes this).

## Things other people have issues with
- **Webcam** The XPS 13 has stupid webcam placement, but I use my phone for video calling.
- **Form Factor** The Surface is also a tablet.
- **Windows Hello** Only the Surface Pro 4 has this, but it's really cool.
- **Windows 10 Pro** The Surface comes with it, but I had a spare license for my XPS.

## What both could do better
- **Trackpad** The trackpad on the Type Cover 4 is too small. The XPS 13 doesn't support four finger gestures. I just wish I could switch desktops with 3 fingers. There's also a lot of apps in Windows that don't handle precision scrolling well \**cough*\* *Electron* \**cough*\*.

- **Windows 10** Sometimes Windows Explorer messes up and I can't use instant search. It's very annoying, and I need to restart the process.

## The Verdict
I like the XPS more, if only because of the nicer screen and significantly better battery. If a tablet and stylus is important to you, get a Surface.
