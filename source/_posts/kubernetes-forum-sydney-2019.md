I recently had the privilege to speak about Xero's Kubernetes platform at [Kubernetes Forum Sydney 2019](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubernetes-forum-sydney-2019/). I focused on how we adopted the mindset of a platform as a product, in order to empower our development teams.

I think it went really well, and received a lot of great feedback afterwards! A recording is now available online for those who missed it.

The talk has also been adapted into a post, for the Humans of Xero Blog. <https://medium.com/humans-of-xero/enabling-world-class-engineering-with-kubernetes-5ff514924ec8>
