# About Me

Hey, I'm Jono. Welcome to my website!

## Xero

I'm currently a Product Owner at [Xero](https://www.xero.com) in TƒÅmaki Makaurau, New Zealand. I'm part of the [bank feeds](https://www.xero.com/features-and-tools/accounting-software/bank-connections/) team, making sure that transactions from thousands of financial institutes get into Xero every single day.

Previously, I was a Software Engineerer on our the platform team, where I was responsible for designing and delivering a large-scale Kubernetes deployment, as well as improving and supporting a large Windows deployment, for all of Xero.

Before that, I was a Graduate Developer - still at Xero!

## Sandfield

I was employed as an Intern at [Sandfield](https://www.sandfield.co.nz) in Auckland, New Zealand from November 2016 - September 2017. I worked with the [Crossfire EDI](http://crossfireedi.com/) team where we built a web app for customers to manage their orders, products, and EDI implementations.

Through the creation of this app, we saw a significant reduction in support time and costs for the Crossfire EDI product.

## Side Projects

### Waka

[Waka](https://waka.app) is a progressive web app for getting around Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch. It uses GTFS and real-time data to provide an easy way to check lines and schedules on the go.

### Other Projects

Unfortunately, I've had to cancel a few side projects.

[Nitro](https://github.com/nitrotasks/nitro) was a beautiful way to get things done, across lots of devices.

[Transfer](https://dymajo.com/transfer) was a great FTP + SFTP app for Windows.

I also helped build [Gradiator](https://launchpad.net/gradiator) (a CSS gradients app), [Lightread](https://github.com/stayradiated/LightRead) - which [won the first Ubuntu App Showdown](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/08/ubuntu-app-showdown-winners-announced), and [Stormcloud](https://github.com/consindo/stormcloud) - a weather app that was [the best selling app in the Ubuntu Store ever](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/tag/stormcloud).

These projects have not been maintained, but the source code is available to download and modify.
