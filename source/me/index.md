# About Me

Hey, I'm Jono. I'm from New Zealand, and currently studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics at the [University of Auckland](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/). In my spare time, I make things (mostly software, sometimes video and other things), run & bike, and spend too much money (mostly on traveling <span class="emoji">ðŸš€</span>).

In my spare time, I like to distract myself with side projects. I helped build [Gradiator](https://launchpad.net/gradiator) (a CSS gradients app), [Nitro](https://github.com/nitrotasks/nitro) (a task management app) and [Lightread](https://github.com/stayradiated/LightRead), which [won the first Ubuntu App Showdown](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/08/ubuntu-app-showdown-winners-announced). I also made [Stormcloud](https://github.com/consindo/stormcloud), a weather app that was [the best selling app in the Ubuntu Store ever](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/tag/stormcloud). Unfortunately software is hard to maintain, so after losing interest, all the apps are pretty much dead. On the positive side, they're all open source which means you can download, modify and almost anything you like with the code.

*But Jono, that was 2012-2013! What have you been doing since?* In 2014, I realized that building open source apps for the rest of your life isn't particularly profitable, so I put some effort into school, tried to get a few scholarships, and took a trip overseas. In 2015, I started University, finally started working on a new app, and then I took three months for another trip around the world.

Now it's 2017 and I'm almost 21. I'm now in my last year at University and I'm currently working as an Intern at [Sandfield](https://www.sandfield.co.nz/). I built an app called called [Transfer](https://dymajo.com), it's an FTP + SFTP app, and we can't release it because of some terrible software design decisions. I also built [Transit](https://transit.dymajo.com), a progressive web app for getting around Auckland's public transport (yes, very niche). Currently I'm trying to bring Nitro back from the dead.
